# Changelog

## 0.1.3 (September 20th, 2022)

-   Fixed: Image dimension and aspect ratio calculations now correctly take into account any `crop` defined on the Sanity image object.
-   Changed: Renamed `IMAGE_WIDTHS` constant to `SOURCE_WIDTHS` so as to be slightly more descriptive. `IMAGE_WIDTHS` is still exported as an alternative name to preserve backwards-compatibility, but this will be removed in the next major version.

-   New: Added JSDoc documentation to utility functions.

## 0.1.2 (August 3rd, 2022)

-   Fixed: Corrected typings for `Img` props.

## 0.1.0 (July 31st, 2022)
