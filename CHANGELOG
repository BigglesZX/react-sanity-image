# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (May 7th, 2025)

- Changed: Dropped support for Node <18
- Changed: Updated `@sanity/client` peerDependency and adjusted typing of `client` props to better match that used by the client image-url builder
- Changed: Updated development tooling â€“ Rollup 4, Storybook 8, ESLint 9, Prettier

## 0.3.0 (October 22nd, 2024)

- Changed: Added missing `sizes` prop when specifying `media` props for `Picture`. This was omitted due to a misunderstanding of how the `sizes` prop on `<source>` elements falls back (it doesn't inherit from the sibling `<img>` element, it defaults to `100vw`).

## 0.2.0 (June 7th, 2023)

- New: Components now support `builderOptions` prop with customisable source widths (thanks to [@james2doyle](https://github.com/james2doyle)).
- Changed: Renamed `SOURCE_WIDTHS` constant to `DEFAULT_SOURCE_WIDTHS`.
- Changed: Components now use a default image quality parameter of `90`.
- Fixed: Improved image layout in Storybook.

## 0.1.3 (September 20th, 2022)

- Fixed: Image dimension and aspect ratio calculations now correctly take into account any `crop` defined on the Sanity image object.
- Changed: Renamed `IMAGE_WIDTHS` constant to `SOURCE_WIDTHS` so as to be slightly more descriptive. `IMAGE_WIDTHS` is still exported as an alternative name to preserve backwards-compatibility, but this will be removed in the next major version.
- New: Added `Img` story to demonstrate image cropping.
- New: Added JSDoc documentation to utility functions.

## 0.1.2 (August 3rd, 2022)

- New: Added `width` and `height` attributes to `img` elements rendered by `Img`.

## 0.1.1 (July 31st, 2022)

- Fixed: Corrected typings for `Img` props.
